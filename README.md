GYM - GAMA for you and me

gym stands for : GAMA for You and Me,   see [wiki](https://github.com/sriramab/gym/wiki)

i.e., for non computer-scientists and non-programmers like You and Me who are social scientists or agent-based modelling enthusiasts with some basic skills in programming.

Experienced GAMA Users and programmers are welcome too :)

This wiki will contain a list of how-to recipes for GAMA. These few recipes are for getting you started with GAMA in no time.The idea of this wiki is to help non computer scientists quickly develop basic skills in GAMA.

All the recipes, for now, are based on use of GAMA on a Apple macOS computer, but for the basics of GAMA it should not really matter.

Good luck !
